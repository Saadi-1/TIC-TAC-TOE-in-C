# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `tic_tac_toe.c` file using a C compiler.
   ```
   gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe
   ```
3. Run the executable.
   ```
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```
4. Follow the instructions to input your moves. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface.
- Validates user inputs to ensure moves are legal.
- Supports multiple rounds with a "play again" option.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)

## Future Improvements

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Add support for different board sizes.
- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
